\section*{Introduction}
The UCI Iris dataset contains features of 150 iris plants from 3 species. In this homework, Gaussian mixture models were applied to cluster the data points.

\section*{Result}
The implementation of Gaussion Mixtrue Models and E-M Algorithm are shown in attached code. In the initialization step, $\pi$ was set to equal, Covariance matrix was set to identity matrix and Mean matrix as random.In the visualization step, the Cross Section and PCA Projection are shown below.
